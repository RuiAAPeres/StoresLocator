# StoresLocator
The goal of the app is to display stores in a map. The app is done in Swift and [Parse](https://parse.com/). I also decided to switch to [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to see how it behaves versus Cocoapods If you want to try it out, make sure to add your own `AppplicationID` and `ClientKey`.
